There are multiple approaches:

Dependency Injection: Inject another directive via constructor.
@Host() or @Optional(): Decorators help access directives in the same DOM tree.
EventEmitter: Emit events from one directive and capture them in another.
Example using DI:

@Directive({ selector: '[childDirective]' })
export class ChildDirective {
  log() {
    console.log('Child directive method called');
  }
}

@Directive({ selector: '[parentDirective]' })
export class ParentDirective {
  constructor(@Optional() private child: ChildDirective) {
    if (child) child.log();
  }
}
